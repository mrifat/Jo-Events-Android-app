== Jo Events

Jo Events Android application is the key feature of the project mrifat.github.io/Jo-Events

The Android application is a ticket holder/scanner, to use the android application you must first install
zxing barcode scanner application(For now) since we use it to scan our the QR code tickets and off course
you must have an internet connection since all the hard work is done on the server side.
